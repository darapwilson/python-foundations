## Setting up your editor (vsCode)

Extensions:

- Python
- MagicPython
- Project Manager
- any color themes you like



Create virtual env

`python -m venv env` in the folder you want the environment named 'env' in.

(assumes python points to python3.  You may need to type python3 instead of python)



Set our virtualenv for this folder:

- `Cmd+Shift+P` ->  Select Workspace Interpreter
- `./env/bin/python`

Now when we use VSCode to run our python files it automatically uses the correct one.
